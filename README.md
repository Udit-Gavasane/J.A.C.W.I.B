This project builds a self driving car which is based on the technique of lane detection using OpenCV. The main processing unit of the car is Raspberry Pi. It makes use of camera module to capture video stream and send it wirelessly to the terminal of the computer executing the program. The computer carries out the task of lane detection and calculates the steering angle. This steering angle is again transferred back to the Raspberry Pi. A client model on the Raspberry Pi gives direction to the car based on the steering angle.
